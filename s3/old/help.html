<p style="text-align:center;">Alexa Service for Counseling</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
ASC an end-to-end Alexa counseling application that helps mitigate the long waiting issue with psychiatry appointments by providing a platform that connects patients directly with counselors. 
Users of our application are college students and counselors. When the patients use our application, they are first directed to talk to a bot and describe their issue. The bot  acts as the primary caregiver and tries to achieve the following goals:
* Ask leading questions to help the user describe the problem
* Categorize the issue according to some specified categories
* Provide some simple resources to help the patient
